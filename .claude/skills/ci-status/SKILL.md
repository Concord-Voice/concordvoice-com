# CI Status

Check CI status for PR #$0, summarize results, and suggest next steps.

---

## Step 1: Fetch check status

```bash
gh pr checks $0 --json name,state,bucket,link,description
```

If the PR doesn't exist, STOP and report the error.

## Step 2: Categorize checks

Group checks using the `bucket` field:

- **Passed** — bucket is `pass` (state is `SUCCESS`)
- **Skipped** — bucket is `skipping` (state is `SKIPPED`)
- **Failed** — bucket is `fail` (state is `FAILURE`)
- **Cancelled** — bucket is `cancel` (state is `CANCELLED`) — treat as a failure for remediation purposes
- **Pending** — bucket is `pending` (state is `PENDING` or `QUEUED`)

## Step 3: If checks are still running

If any checks are Pending, report current status and offer to poll:

```
CI Status — PR #$0 (in progress)
────────────────────────────────────────────────
✅ Passed: N checks
❌ Failed: N checks
⏳ Pending: N checks — [list names]

Still running. Run /ci-status $0 again in a few minutes,
or use /loop 2m /ci-status $0 to auto-poll.
────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

## Step 4: If all checks passed

```
CI Status — PR #$0 (all green)
────────────────────────────────────────────────
✅ All N checks passed

Ready to mark for review. Run:
  gh pr ready $0
This marks the PR as ready for human and automated review.
────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

Ask the developer: "All checks passed. Mark PR as ready for review?"

If yes:
```bash
gh pr ready $0
```

## Step 5: If any checks failed

```
CI Status — PR #$0 (failures detected)
────────────────────────────────────────────────
✅ Passed: N checks
❌ Failed: N checks

Failed checks:
  1. [check-name] — [link]
  2. [check-name] — [link]
────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

Then for each failed check, suggest remediation based on the check name:

| Check name pattern | Remediation |
|---|---|
| `build` or `test` | "Run tests locally in the affected package (e.g. `go test -race ./...` or `npm test`)" |
| `sonarqube` or `quality-gate` | "If a local quality-gate skill is available (e.g. `/verify-quality-gate`), run it to check coverage and quality locally; otherwise open the check link" |
| `lint` or `eslint` or `golangci` | "Run the linter in the affected package (e.g. `golangci-lint run` or `npm run lint`)" |
| `semgrep` or `sast` | "Check Semgrep findings: `semgrep scan --config auto`" |
| `gitleaks` or `trufflehog` | "Secret detected — check git history for accidentally committed credentials" |
| `spa-check` | "SPA version may need bumping — check the frontend package's `package.json` version" |
| Unknown | "View details: [link]" |

For more details on a failure, open the check's link URL in the browser or use:

```bash
gh pr checks $0 --json name,link,bucket --jq '.[] | select(.bucket == "fail" or .bucket == "cancel") | .name + " → " + .link'
```

## What This Skill Does NOT Do

- Does not fix failures automatically (suggests remediation only)
- Does not mark PR as ready without developer confirmation
- Does not poll automatically (use `/loop` plugin for that)
- Does not give time estimates for pending checks

## Why This Skill Exists

After pushing a PR, the developer currently runs `gh pr checks` manually, parses the output, and figures out what failed. This skill does that in one command with actionable remediation suggestions. It also handles the "all green → mark ready" transition that triggers Copilot review, bridging Phases 9-12 of the dev-lifecycle pipeline (#585).
